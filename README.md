Ajax-form-fill-Indian-pincodes
==============================

Enter a pincode and the city, district and state will automatically get filled. Just some basic use of web technologies.

I have this code here that should help create auto fill fields in forms. I am not writing an entire explanation about
its working here. If you would like to read in details about this project, check out my blog post
http://www.nagekar.com/2014/12/creating-autocomplete-field-with-ajax.html although the code is pretty self explanatory.

Thank you for using.
